                  <Name>iPad 2 with Wifi - 32GB</Name>
                  <Description><![CDATA[The NEW Apple iPad 2 - Thinner, lighter, and full of great ideas.  Once you pick up iPad 2, it’ll be hard to put down.  That’s the idea behind the all-new design. It’s 33 percent thinner and up to 15 percent lighter, so it feels even more comfortable in your hands.  And, it makes surfing the web, checking email, watching movies, and reading books so natural, you might forget there’s incredible technology under your fingers.<br><br><b>Dual-core A5 chip</b>.<br> Two powerful cores in one A5 chip mean iPad can do twice the work at once.  You’ll notice the difference when you’re surfing the web, watching movies, making FaceTime video calls, gaming, and going from app to app to app.  Multitasking is smoother, apps load faster, and everything just works better.<br><br><b>Superfast graphics</b>. <br>With up to nine times the graphics performance, gameplay on iPad is even smoother and more realistic.  And faster graphics help apps perform better — especially those with video.  You’ll see it when you’re scrolling through your photo library, editing video with iMovie, and viewing animations in Keynote.<br><br><b>Battery life keeps on going. So you can, too.</b><br> Even with the new thinner and lighter design, iPad has the same amazing 10-hour battery life.  That’s enough juice for one flight across the ocean, or one movie-watching all-nighter, or a week’s commute across town.  The power-efficient A5 chip and iOS keep battery life from fading away, so you can get carried away.<br><br><b>Two cameras.</b><br> You’ll see two cameras on iPad — one on the front and one on the back.  They may be tiny, but they’re a big deal.  They’re designed for FaceTime video calling, and they work together so you can talk to your favorite people and see them smile and laugh back at you. The front camera puts you and your friend face-to-face.  Switch to the back camera during your video call to share where you are, who you’re with, or what’s going on around you. When you’re not using FaceTime, let the back camera roll if you see something movie-worthy. It’s HD, so whatever you shoot is a mini-masterpiece. And you can take wacky snapshots in Photo Booth. It’s the most fun a face can have.<br><br><b>Due to the demand for this item, please allow up to 8-10 weeks for delivery</b>.]]></Description>

                  <Description>The WindTunnel® T-Series™ vacuums feature Hoover's patented Windtunnel® technology with air passages that trap dirt and channel it into the dirt cup, significantly minimizing blowback or scattering back onto the floor. While each model is lightweight, they offer full Hoover power for a deep down clean and no loss of suction. This hi-tech bagless vacuum has ingenious options, such as fingertip controls conveniently located within reach on the handle and a height adjustment feature to ensure roll brushes are at the proper height. A cord clip is just below the handle on the back side of the unit and it keeps the cord out of the way while cleaning. Requiring minimal maintenance, the WindTunnel® T-Series™ has a rinsable filter that can be easily cleaned under running water and a high quality HEPA filter - neither of which will need to be replaced with proper care. On-Board tools include Turbo brush, 12'' extension wand, crevice tool and upholstery/dust brush.</Description>
